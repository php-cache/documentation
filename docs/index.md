# PHP Cache 

<img align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/php-cache/documentation/master/logos/php-cache-logo-256.png" />


The PHP Cache organization is dedicated to providing solid, powerful, flexible, and lightweight caching libraries for PHP
projects. All of the adapters we have created are [PSR-6](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-6/) and [PSR-16](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-16/) 
compliant. If you are a library implementer, we even have a [repository of tests ](https://github.com/php-cache/integration-tests) 
to help you meet the PSR specification.

Below you will find information about what features our libraries offer, and what adapters we have. You can also find out
framework integration libraries.

If you are new to PSR-6 caching you may want to have a look at our [introduction](introduction.md).

> Note: The PHP-cache organization has been pushing the limits of caching for many years. But currently we fall behind the quicker and better maintained [Symfony Cache](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/cache.html).

## Cache pool implementations

There are plenty of adapters in this organization. Each of them lives in a different repository. Splitting them up in multiple
packages complies with the *Common reuse principle* and makes it easier for the developer to follow the changes of a specific
adapter. 

Each adapter has it own features. The table below lists all our adapters and their features.

\* *Hierarchy store lots of extra items in cache that are never actively removed. Some implementations of cache storages 
like Redis and Memcache will automatically remove these items when they're stale or no longer used. That is why hierarchy
will work better on such cache storages.*
  


### Chain adapter

We also have a chain adapter where you can chain multiple pool together. It is great if you have a fast storage with limited 
memory and a slower storage with loads of memory. 

### Doctrine adapter

The doctrine adapter is a PSR-6 adapter that wraps a `Doctrine\Common\Cache\Cache` object. With this adapter you can use 
storages like Riak and WinCache which currently do not have any PHP Cache adapters. 

## Installation

Use composer to install any of the adapters above. Some adapters may require configuration before they can be used. 
Refer to the adapter's Github page to see how they are configured. You could also use the Symfony [AdapterBundle] to 
configure the adapters. 

```bash
composer require cache/[any]-adapter
```

You can also install all of the adapters with the `cache/cache`

```bash
composer require cache/cache
```

### Requirements

Unless other is specified, all adapters support PHP version `^5.5` and `^7.0`. Most adapters do also have requirements
on PHP extension. Like the Redis adapter requires `ext-redis`. 

## Features

#### Tagging

Tags is used to control the invalidation of items. 

```php
$item = $pool->getItem('tobias');
$item->set('value')->setTags(['tag0', 'tag1'])
$pool->save($item);

$item = $pool->getItem('aaron');
$item->set('value')->setTags(['tag0']);
$pool->save($item);

// Remove everything tagged with 'tag1'
$pool->invalidateTags(['tag1']);
$pool->getItem('tobias')->isHit(); // false
$pool->getItem('aaron')->isHit(); // true

$item = $pool->getItem('aaron');
echo $item->getPreviousTags(); // array('tag0')

// No tags will be saved again. This is the same as saving
// an item with no tags.
$pool->save($item);
```

#### Hierarchy

Think of a hierarchy like a file system. If you remove a folder "Foo", all items and folders in "Foo" will also be removed. 
A hierarchical cache key must start with a pipe ("|").


```php
$pool->hasItem('|users|4711|followers|12|likes'); // True
$pool->deleteItem('|users|4711|followers');
$pool->hasItem('|users|4711|followers|12|likes'); // False
```

#### Namespace

Namespace can be used to separate the storage of different systems in the cache. This allows different sections to be cleared
on an individual level, while also preventing overlapping keys.

```php
$pool = new ArrayCachePool();

$namespaceFoo = new NamespacedCachePool($pool, 'foo');
$item = $namespaceFoo->getItem('key')->set('value');
$namespaceFoo->save($item);

$namespaceBar = new NamespacedCachePool($pool, 'bar');
$namespaceBar->hasItem('key'); // False
$item = $namespaceBar->getItem('key')->set('value');
$namespaceBar->save($item);

$namespaceBar->hasItem('key'); // True
$namespaceFoo->deleteItem('key');
$namespaceFoo->hasItem('key'); // False
$namespaceBar->hasItem('key'); // True

$namespaceFoo->clear();
$namespaceBar->hasItem('key'); // True
```

#### Prefix

A prefix will help you to avoid cache key collisions. The prefixed cache pool supports any PSR-6 
cache implementations. The PrefixedCachePool differs from the NamespacedCachePool in two aspects: 

1) You could still have conflicts if one cache key includes the prefix
2) When clearing the cache all cache items will be cleared, not only the prefixed ones. 

```php
$pool = new ArrayCachePool();

$prefixedFoo = new PrefixedCachePool($pool, 'foo');
$item = $prefixedFoo->getItem('key')->set('value');
$prefixedFoo->save($item);

$pool->hasItem('key'); // False
$item = $pool->getItem('key')->set('value');
$pool->save($item);

$pool->hasItem('key'); // True
$prefixedFoo->deleteItem('key');
$prefixedFoo->hasItem('key'); // False
$pool->hasItem('key'); // True

$prefixedFoo->clear();
$pool->hasItem('key'); // False
```


## Framework integration

#### Symfony

There are two Symfony bundles; [AdapterBundle] and [CacheBundle]. 

The AdapterBundle is used to configure and register a PSR-6 cache pool as a Symfony service. The  CacheBundle is used to 
integrate **any** PSR-6 cache service with the framework. It supports session cache, doctrine cache, validation cache and 
many more. 

We would LOVE to see integration with Zend, Laravel, Yii, Cake, and even Code Igniter. If you would like to contribute, 
we would love to see your code.
